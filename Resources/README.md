Hello! This is the README.md for my(Damian Villarreal-Ayala) DiceGame project created for CS2.
To run the program, just run it as you usually would. You will have to switch between the window and terminal frequently
to play the game as intended, but make sure not to do it super quickly as it caused an error sometimes when I was testing
the code. There aren't many rules to the game, just role the dice the first time(done for you automatically) and then 
choose to roll again if you want to. Both the terminal and window will display how much you earned in that round, but the
window will show the total score and rules of the game at all teams in the top right and left corners. Once the game is
over, the scores will be tallied and the player with the higher score wins unless there is a tie. The winning message 
for both the window and terminal is the same. I didn't experience any other bugs or issues while testing.
